# 🚀 Fix Vercel Deployment Issues

## ✅ Issues Fixed

1. **Removed localhost URL** from `vercel.json` environment variables
2. **Added proper build commands** with `npm ci` for clean installs
3. **Added Node.js version** specification (`.nvmrc`)
4. **Optimized Vercel configuration** for Vite projects

## 🔧 Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Commit and Push Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables in Vercel

**Go to Vercel Dashboard:**

1. Visit your project on Vercel
2. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add these variables:

```
VITE_API_URL = https://your-backend-url.com/api
```

**Example:**

```
VITE_API_URL = https://hypemode-backend.railway.app/api
```

### 3. Redeploy

**Option A: Automatic (Recommended)**

- Push to your main branch
- Vercel will automatically redeploy

**Option B: Manual**

- Go to Vercel Dashboard
- Click "Redeploy" on your latest deployment

## 🐛 Common Vercel Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Build Timeout

**Solution:** The build should now be faster with optimized configuration.

### Issue 2: Environment Variables Not Working

**Solution:**

- Variables must start with `VITE_`
- Redeploy after adding variables
- Check variable names are correct

### Issue 3: Module Not Found Errors

**Solution:**

- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check import paths are correct
- Verify file extensions (.js, .jsx)

### Issue 4: CORS Errors in Production

**Solution:**

- Deploy your backend first
- Update backend CORS to include your Vercel domain
- Use HTTPS URLs for production
